## 10.1 Overview of Flash Device Layout

The **GenFds** tool is typically called after a platform build's $(MAKE) Stage
completes. The **build.exe** command will call **GenFds**. The **GenFds**
program can also be executed by the developer from the command line.

In order to execute from the command-line, the tool needs to have its
environment setup. The following is an example of executing GenFds as a
stand-alone command.

```
GenFds -f $(WORKSPACE)\Nt32Pkg\Nt32Pkg.fdf \
  -o $(WORKSPACE)\Build\NT32\DEBUG_MYTOOLS -t MYTOOLS -b DEBUG -v \
  -p $(WORKSPACE)\Nt32Pkg\Nt32Pkg.dsc -a IA32
```

**GenFds**

calls several other tools during the generation of an FD image:

**GenSec**

This application is used to generate valid `EFI_SECTION` type files from
PE32/PE32+/ COFF image files or other binary files. The utility will attach a
valid section or PEIM header to the input file as defined in the PI
specification.

**GenFfs**

This application is used to generate FFS files for inclusion in a firmware
volume. Rules specified in the FDF file stipulate how the FFS file will be
organized (what kind of sections should reside in it and in what format).

**GenFv**

This application is used to generate FV image by taking what and how to place
FFS into it from the corresponding FV.inf file.

**GenFw**

This application is used to generate UEFI Firmware Image files based on
Component or Module types listed in the INF files from the PE/PE32+/COFF images
generated by the third party tool chains.

**GenVtf**

This application generates the Boot Strap File (AKA Volume Top File, or VTF)
for IA32 X64, and IPF images.

Figure 22 shows how the above tools involved in the GenFds process.
