## 9.6 Generate Module Images

The final images generated by building a module are files which can be
recognized by EFI/Framework protocols. The types of those files supported by
default are EFI executable image file (.efi), ACPI machine language file
(.aml), ACPI table file (.acpi), real mode executable file (.com) and microcode
binary file (.bin).

The .efi file will be generated for non-library modules which have C files
declared. It's converted from .dll file created during the dynamic link step by
the GenFw tool. Also:

* The .aml file is generated from .asl file in Compile/Assembly step.
* The .acpi file is converted from .dll file by the **GenFw** tool.
* The .com file is generated in the Dynamic Link step by real mode linker
  (ASMLINK).
* The .bin file is converted from .txt file by the **GenFw** tool.

### 9.6.1 GenFw

This tool is used to generate UEFI Firmware Image files based on Component or
Module types listed in the INF files from the PE/PE32+/COFF images generated by
the third party tool chains. This takes `.dll` files created during the compile
portion of the $(MAKE) stage, converting the header and creating the .efi
files. Additional functions of the GenFw tool are discussed in Post-Build
ImageGen Stage - FLASH Images, Section 10.
