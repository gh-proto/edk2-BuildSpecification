## 9.1 Overview

From a platform point of view (remember, all builds are in the context of a
platform, even when the desired output may only be a driver), what will be done
in $(MAKE) stage includes building library modules, building non-library
modules and finally (if the desired output is a file to be burned into a flash
part on a physical platform) generating flash image(s).

From a module point of view, things done in $(MAKE) stage includes
preprocessing, compiling or assembling, static/dynamic linking and module image
generation.

### 9.1.1 File Extensions for UEFI image files.

This section details the intermediate file extensions that generated by the
$(MAKE) stage of the build process. This stage involves processing source files
and generating dynamic objects which are further processed by the **GenFw** tool
to create .efi files.

###### Table 17 $(MAKE) Stage Intermediate Output File Extensions

| Extension | Description                                         |
|:---------:| --------------------------------------------------- |
| .obj      | Object files generated by $(MAKE) stage             |
| .lib      | Static Linked files generated by $(MAKE) stage      |
| .dll      | Dynamically Linked files generated by $(MAKE) stage |
| .aml      | ACPI code files generated by $(MAKE) stage          |
| .i, .iii  | Trim and C Pre-Processor output files               |
| .bin      | Microcode files                                     |

###### Table 18 $(MAKE) Stage Output File Extensions

| Extension   | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|:-----------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .efi        | Non UEFI Applications, DXE Drivers, DXE Runtime Drivers, DXE SAL Drivers have the Subsystem type field of the DOS/TE header set to `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_APPLICATION`, `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_BOOT_SERVICE_DRIVER`, `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_RUNTIME_DRIVER` and `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_SAL_RUNTIME_DRIVER` respectively. |
|             | For a Security Module, the Subsystem type is set to `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_BOOT_SERVICE_DRIVER`.                                                                        |
|             | For `PEI_CORE`, `DXE_CORE`, `PEIM`, `DXE_SMM_DRIVER`, `UEFI_APPLICATION`, `UEFI_DRIVER`, the Subsystem type is set to `EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_BOOT_SERVICE_DRIVER`.      |
| .acpi       | ASL or IASL compiled ACPI tables                                                                                                                                          |
| .depex      | Compiled dependency sections                                                                                                                                              |
| .mcb        | Microcode Binary files                                                                                                                                                    |

Additional modifications to the files are permitted. Modifications that
recommended are as follows:

```
TimeStructure can be modified to a given date using a data structure of
tm_mon,// months since January, [0,11]
tm_mday,// day of the month [1,31]
tm_year,// years since 1900
tm_hour,// hours since midnight [0,23]
tm_min,// minutes after the hour [0,59]
tm_sec,// seconds after the minute [0,59]
```

Subsystemfield is changed to one of the following:

```
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_UNKNOWN                  0
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_NATIVE                   1
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_GUI              2
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_CUI              3
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_OS2_CUI                  5
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_POSIX_CUI                7
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_APPLICATION          10
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_BOOT_SERVICE_DRIVER  11
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_RUNTIME_DRIVER       12
EFI_IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_SAL_RUNTIME_DRIVER       13
```

The Machine value in the PE image file header is used to indicate the machine
code type of the image. The following values are set for UEFI images:

```
EFI_IMAGE_MACHINE_IA32  0x014C
EFI_IMAGE_MACHINE_IA64  0x0200
EFI_IMAGE_MACHINE_x64   0x8664
EFI_IMAGE_MACHINE_EBC   0x0EBC
```
